# AEGONTECH LLC

## Description

A modern, elegant company website for AEGONTECH LLC that automatically showcases SaaS products and mobile apps through intelligent URL-based portfolio management, features a blog powered by n8n automation, and includes a secure admin panel — all built on Supabase with cutting-edge SEO.

## Problems & Solutions

### Problem 1: Manual Portfolio Updates Are Tedious
Adding new products to a portfolio typically requires taking screenshots, writing descriptions, and manually updating the website. AEGONTECH LLC solves this by automatically extracting screenshots and metadata from any URL — whether it's a web app, App Store listing, or Play Store page.

### Problem 2: Content Creation Bottleneck
Creating and publishing blog content manually is time-consuming. The n8n-powered blog API handles automated content publishing with images, allowing the team to focus on creating value rather than managing uploads.

### Problem 3: Scattered Product Presentation
Showcasing both SaaS applications and mobile apps in a cohesive, professional manner is challenging. The unified portfolio system presents all products beautifully with consistent styling and automatic metadata.
